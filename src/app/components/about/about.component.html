                <p class="text-gray-500 mt-2">
                    Junior Leaders School System has been established as a welfare institution embedded with the
                    Philanthropic passion
                    to educate girls from poor families. Pakistan with present population of about 180 million has over
                    52% female
                    population.

                    The high rate of population growth, lack of educational facilities and socio economic problems
                    confronted by a vast
                    segment of society is depriving continuous education to the children. The uneducated and poor
                    parents with extremely
                    low per capita income have simultaneously been gripped by self-sponsored social and family problems
                    by ignoring
                    education of their children.Whereas,those parents who genuinely want to educate their children and
                    are below poverty
                    line cannot provide better education.Moreover,there is a social dilemma in our society and the
                    domestic culture that
                    a very large majority of parents give priority to their sons and ignore their daughter+//3//f/9-s
                    education.This is
                    a big social dilemma for seeking education because they have limited resources.

                    The poor parents can behelped through their daughter+//3//f/9-s education and grooming to progress
                    and be guided
                    towards a bright future. Education is the best window of opportunity and a ladder out of poverty,
                    leading the entire
                    family towards prosperity. Therefore, to support the national cause of improving literacy, this
                    school system has
                    planned +//3//f/9-FREE+//3//f/9 quality modern education forgirlshailing from poor/low
                    incomefamilies. This in fact,
                    is a Theme, aThought and a Theory, coupled witha mission and pragmatic approach to educate and groom
                    girls.
